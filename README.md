# The-Reason
Why did i choose to study software engineering ? 
one of the reasons is that i used to take software courses when i was a child 
also i am orginaliy from palestine the land of the war , i love my country more then anything else in this world and i believe that i have to study as much hard as i can to be a good person who can help my country in the future 
software is the future and also its the job which in everyware i mean every thing in this world excpet humans , need software 
i believe that my country will be free one day inshallah . 


away from everything Mrs. Ahmet i wish if you can pray for our people in gaza ..
